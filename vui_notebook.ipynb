It is **NOT** necessary to include new layer types that were not explored in the notebook.\n",

To add dropout to [recurrent layers](https://faroit.github.io/keras-docs/1.0.2/layers/recurrent/), pay special attention to the `dropout_W` and `dropout_U` arguments.  This [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287) may also provide some interesting theoretical background.\n",
    "- If you choose to include a convolutional layer in your model, you may get better results by working with **dilated convolutions**.  If you choose to use dilated convolutions, make sure that you are able to accurately calculate the length of the acoustic model's output in the `model.output_length` lambda function.  You can read more about dilated convolutions in Google's [WaveNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).  For an example of a speech-to-text system that makes use of dilated convolutions, check out this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet).  You can work with dilated convolutions [in Keras](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) by paying special attention to the `padding` argument when you specify a convolutional layer.\n",

This attribute is a lambda function that maps the (temporal) length of the input acoustic features to the (temporal) length of the output softmax layer.  This function is used in the computation of CTC loss; to see this, look at the `add_ctc_loss` function in `train_utils.py`.  To see where the `output_length` attribute is defined for the models in the code, take a look at the `sample_models.py` file.  You will notice this line of code within most models:\n",
